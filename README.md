# JspsychAngular
*Work in progress*

This project implemented [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/) as an Angular library. This library would provide more flexible experiment timeline implementation, including timelines hosted on the server-side. This would also allow experiment trials implemented as native Angular components instead of plain HTML.
